                        I've worked at all levels of the software stack.  I've contributed to open source projects such as <a class="link" href="http://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/scamper/">Scamper</a> and <a class="link" href="http://linux-ip.net/software/#atelerix">Atelerix</a>. I strongly advocate in my work for building systems with a focus on maintainability and extensibility. I work hard to understand the needs and requirements of the clients and projects I work with to deliver on time and high quality software. I thrive in a team setting working collaboratively to grow in each others abilities learning and sharing our experiences developing world class software systems and applications.
